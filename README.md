# 🚀 Project 5: Containerize and Deploy App with Docker

## 📌 Problem Statement
Traditional application deployments are often:
- Complex and time-consuming
- Error-prone due to inconsistencies across environments
- Difficult to scale and manage

## 🎯 Objective
Containerize a **Node.js** or **Python** web application using Docker and deploy it on an **AWS EC2** instance to ensure:
- Environment consistency
- Portability
- Scalability

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Docker**
- **AWS EC2**
- **Node.js** or **Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI)**
- **Dockerfile**
- `docker-compose` *(optional)*

## 🐳 Dockerfile Example (Python Flask)

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 🔹 1. Launch EC2 Instance

* Ubuntu 22.04 recommended
* Allow ports `22`, `80`, and `5000` in the security group

### 🔹 2. SSH into EC2

```bash
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
```

### 🔹 3. Install Docker

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

### 🔹 4. Clone Your Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 🔹 5. Build and Run Container

```bash
docker build -t myapp .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 myapp
```

Now your app should be accessible at:
`http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:5000`

---

## ✅ Expected Outcome

* A containerized application successfully deployed and running on an AWS EC2 instance.
* Scalable and consistent environment via Docker.
